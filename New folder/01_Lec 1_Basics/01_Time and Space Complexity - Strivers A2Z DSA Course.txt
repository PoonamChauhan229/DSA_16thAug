What is Time Complexity?
>Any interview, we write the code , they judge on us on the basis of Time Complexity.

Time complexity != Time Taken

Same code , if we run on 2 machines
1- machine takes 2s
2- machine takes 1s

Depending upon the system the time taken to execute the code is different,it is dependant on configuration,hence Time complexity != Time Taken

So Time Compexity?
Rate at which the time taken increases with respect to input size.

Time Complexity > Big-On Notation -> O(timetaken)
timetaken > No of steps taken to execute the code .
So we cannot keep on manually counting the steps
So Time Complexity should always be calculated in terms of 
>worst case scenario
>Aviod constants
>avoid lower values

Why Worst case

for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
    cout<< "Raj";
}
>> 5*3= 15 times execution
>> O(15) 
It a number and we dont represent the code in terms of number .
for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
    cout<< "Raj";
}
>> O(3N)  -- This is the time Complexity

Now there are 3 cases,

Snippet of Code :
if(marks<25)         cout <<"grade D"
else if(marks<45)    cout <<"grade C"
else if(marks<65)    cout <<"grade B"
else                 cout <<"grade A"

Best Case                  Average Case               Worst Case
